This fork is a collection of improvements to Bitcoin Core maintained out of the
master git tree.

== Patch files ==
This patchset is distributed as 4 independent patch files:


=== syslibs ===
Adds options to build Bitcoin Core against system LevelDB and libsecp256k1
libraries (see ./configure --help for usage).

Please note this may be dangerous and make theft from you possible if used with
versions of the libraries which have not been audited to meet the bug-for-bug
compatibility required by Bitcoin's consensus protocol. The patch leaves these
options disabled by default for this reason.
