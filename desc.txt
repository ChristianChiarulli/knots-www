This branch is a collection of improvements to Bitcoin Core maintained out of
the master git tree.

== Patch files ==
This patchset is distributed as 7 independent patch files:


=== syslibs ===
Adds options to build Bitcoin Core against system LevelDB and libsecp256k1
libraries (see ./configure --help for usage).

Please note this may be dangerous and make theft from you possible if used with
versions of the libraries which have not been audited to meet the bug-for-bug
compatibility required by Bitcoin's consensus protocol. The patch leaves these
options disabled by default for this reason.

It also extends the OpenRC init script to be more configurable, and adds options
to disable building bitcoin-cli or bitcoin-tx individually.

considering fees. See also:
- CreateNewBlock: Child-pays-for-parent / Add transaction fee later
  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/1647


=== spamfilter ===
This is a policy change that improves the spam filtering capabilities of Bitcoin
Core, notably including pattern matching for notorious spammer scripts.
Specifically, spam created by the following are identified and ignored:
- BetCoin Dice
- Correct Horse Battery Staple
- Old spammy Counterparty encoding (NOT current versions of Counterparty)
- Lucky Bit
- Mastercoin
- SatoshiBones
- SatoshiDICE

(Note that the organizations and people /responsible/ for the spam are /not/
filtered, only the spam itself.)

datacarrier transactions. See also:
- Accept any sequence of PUSHDATAs in OP_RETURN outputs

  https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/4298

Note that this patch is Peter Todd's replace-by-fee-v0.11.2 git branch, slightly

patched with this patchset.
